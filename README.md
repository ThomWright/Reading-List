Other recommendations appreciated!


## Currently Reading

**Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests** - Steve Freeman, Nat Pryce

**The Phoenix Project** - Gene Kim, George Spafford, Kevin Behr

**Learn You a Haskell for Great Good** - Miran Lipovaƒça

A fantastically written introduction to the Haskell language. Some prefer a more academic writing style, personally I prefer Miran's more laid back (and often humorous) approach to tackling the language. Never before has Haskell been so accessible for beginners. This book is a wonderful achievement.

## Previously Read

**Effective Java** -  Joshua Bloch

An essential book for any serious Java developer. In 78 self-contained items, Joshua Bloch expertly explains the best ways to use the language, as well as what to avoid. The writing is crystal clear with judicious use of examples. Perfect for reading groups.

**Javascript: The Good Parts** - Douglas Crockford

Due to the increasing importance of web browsers and the rise of NodeJS (and despite its shortcomings), Javascript is becoming one of the most essential languages in a programmers arsenal. Douglas Crockford encourages programmers to use Javascript to its full potential by effective using its best features, and avoiding the worst.

**Clean Code / Clean Coder** - Robert C. Martin

**Apprenticeship Patterns** - David H. Hoover, Adewale Oshineye
